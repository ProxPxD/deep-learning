# Deep Learning
Python implementations of various deep learning algorithms.

## Usage
```
python3 fnn/fnn.py
```
## Backlog
- Activation functions: linear, sigmoid, relu, tanh, softmax
- Loss functions: mse, ce
- Persist: outputs, losses, PDs, gradients, weights
- Performance metrics: TPs, FPs, accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score
- Graphing performance as a function of iteration count and batch size
- k-folds cross-validation
- Write mathematics in LaTeX in markdown file
- L2 Regularisation (add term to loss function) and drop-out
- Iterate until convergence to a tolerance level of a metric, or maximum iterations
